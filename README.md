# mpd-distrobox

## Description

Attempt to make mpd and friends work within a container on Fedora Atomic and friends

clients like mpc, ncmpcpp, Plattenalbum etc. can be installed from brew/flatpak and can be used without any problems

for now you have to manually start mpd mpd-mpris/mpDris2 inside the distrobox

the mpris stuff doesn't have any graphical output for whatever reason
